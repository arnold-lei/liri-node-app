##Terminal Application:

I used this librarry to style my terminal: https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-kit

##Challenges:

I am starting to get the hang of using callbacks. Working on these terminal apps is a challenge for me. I am a very visual learner and I like to see what I'm doing. I found manipulating the dom and working in the browser to be a lot easier. Maybe I should challenge myself and try to build more terminal applications.
